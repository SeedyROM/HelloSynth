# 🎶 HelloSynth 🎶

## What is this?

Well I wanted to make a simple synthesizer, I started on my computer but realized that since I'm using SDL2 I can port my work to iOS!

## Goals

- [x] Setup SDL2 on iOS
- [x] Render a simple background color
- [x] Be able to write data to the audio callback
- [ ] Simple transport UI
  - [ ] Have a 8 \* 16 grid of squares that act as a basic sequencer
  - [ ] Create a simple transport playback head
  - [ ] Create a simple transport to trigger each square when it's hit by the playback head
  - [ ] Play some sounds???
- [ ] _TBD_

## Setup

**Follow the instruction from here [here](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/52_hello_mobile/ios_mac/index.php) to link SDL into the Xcode project!**
